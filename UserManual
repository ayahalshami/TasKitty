Flow

Welcome screen
  - Name your cat
  - Pick from the two cat types
    - Tabby: 4 stages, intended for busier periods
    - Siamese: 3 stages, slightly shorter evolution
  - Press start new game 
    - (optionally, you may continue an old session, but there will not be any save data on your first time running and a default tabby pet will be made)

Task screen
  - Provide description of your task
  - Set time to work on task
  - click create task

Timer Screen
  - Displays countdown timer
  - 00:00 minute:second format
  - no other ui on this screen in order to minimize distractions

End screen
  - When the timer ends, task is marked as complete
  - History is saved and can be accessed from this screen

Pet Growth
  - Cat is awared focus points per each minute played
    - currrently, the requirement for growth is your cats level multiplied by 30 points
      - ie, the first level takes 30 minutes, the next takes 60, the next is 90, etc
  - The stages are as follows
    - Egg (level 1)
    - Baby (level 2)
    - Teen (Level 3)
    - Adult (Level 4, Tabby only)
  - Header on top of screen keeps track of your cats level as well as their name and the amount of tasks completed

Save progress
  - Your session is saved automatically 
    - saves after completing a task
    - when application is closed
    - when pet is made
  - Simply click "continue game" to continue last session

Troubleshooting:
  - If images won't load, ensure that file system is sorted as shown above
  - Minutes field will only take whole numbers and not integers
  - Continue game will only work if you have previously used app, otherwise it creates a default Tabby cat named TaskCat
