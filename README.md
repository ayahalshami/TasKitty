Welcome to TasKitty!
This is a simple and rewarding task management app that allows you to set a focus timer.
The more you focus, the more your pet grows!
In order to run this app, you must have JavaFx installed with a compatible JDK.
To set up the app, simply import it into your IDE of choice, ensuring that your files are organized as follows:
- src (main directory)
    - images (sub directory)
        -background.png   
        -siamese (sub directory)
          - baby.png
          - egg.png
          - teen.png
        -tabby  (sub directory)
          - baby.png
          - egg.png
          - teen.png
          - adult.png
    - TasKitty (sub directory)
         - AppGUI.java
         - Pet.java
         - SaveManager.java
         - SiameseCat.java
         - TabbyCat.java
         - TaskHistory.java
     
Once app is set up properly, all you need to do is press run!
You'll be greeted with a startup menu that prompts you to input your pet name and pick between either a siamese or tabby cat.
After you have your pet created, you need to fill in the fields for your task name and time.
Once you complete your task, you can either restart or view previous tasks.
If you exit the app and wish to rejoin your previous session, simply click the continue game button on the start up screen to reload your previous data.
Happy tasking!
